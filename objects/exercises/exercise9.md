```js
let foo = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
};

let qux = 'hello';

function bar(argument1, argument2) {
  argument1.a = 'hi';
  argument2 = 'hi';
}

bar(foo, qux);

console.log(foo.a);
console.log(qux);
```

Line 15 will output `hi` and line 16 will output `hello`.

On line 14, the `bar` function is invoked and is passed `foo` and `qux` as arguments, binding their values to the function's parameters `argument1` and `argument1`, respectively.

For `argument1`, the key `'a'` has its value reassigned to `'hi'`, causing the object to be mutated to preserve this new value. Because both `foo` and `argument1` reference the same object in memory, the object referenced by `foo` will also see this change and is logged to the console when passing `foo.a` as an argument to `console.log()`.

For `argument2`, the local variable is simply reassigned to the value `'hi'`. This reassignment **only affects** `argument2`, causing the alias relationship between `argument2` and `qux` to be broken. Therefore, when passing `qux` as an argument to `console.log()`, the original value of `'hello'` is preserved, which is what is seen logged to the console.
